## üöÄ **Overview**  

**SideProjector** is a dedicated platform for developers to showcase, collaborate on, and even sell their side projects. In the latest version, we‚Äôve introduced **group chat** and **P2P chat** features, allowing developers to communicate, collaborate, and connect directly on the platform. This creates a vibrant community and makes project management seamless.  

We have reimagined the platform with improved UI, enhanced search filters, better performance, and a focus on creating a collaborative developer marketplace.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Why We Rebuilt SideProjector**  

The original SideProjector had promising potential but lacked some crucial features, such as:  
- **Limited Collaboration Tools:** No way to connect directly with other developers.  
- **Basic Messaging System:** Users couldn‚Äôt effectively discuss projects or negotiate deals.  
- **Outdated Communication Features:** A lack of real-time chat limited platform usability.  

With this version, we‚Äôre creating a community-driven marketplace where developers can **showcase, collaborate, and communicate** effectively.
